## 💻 Usage Examples

### User Input Example 1

```

Every day, I write a daily report in Notion and also register events in Google Calendar. I’d like to notify my boss on Slack too.

```

#### GPT Example Output

```

This process can be automated in Make as follows:

1. Trigger when a new daily report page is created in Notion
2. Add a new event in Google Calendar at a specified time
3. Send a Slack message saying “A daily report has been registered.”

Make structure:
Trigger: Notion → Watch Database Item
Action: Google Calendar → Create an Event
Action: Slack → Send a Message

In English:
"New Notion page → Add Google Calendar event → Send Slack message"

```

### User Input Example 2

```

When someone submits a Google Form, I want to automatically transfer the data into a spreadsheet and notify the person in charge via Slack.

```

#### GPT Example Output

```

This process can also be automated using Zapier:

1. Trigger: Google Forms → New Form Response
2. Action: Google Sheets → Create Spreadsheet Row
3. Action: Slack → Send Channel Message

In English:
